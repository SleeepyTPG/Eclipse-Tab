# eTab - Tablist plugin configuration
# This file uses MiniMessage formatting for header/footer and formats.
# Gradients can be referenced by name via <gradient:name>text</gradient> — defined under 'gradients'.
# If PlaceholderAPI is installed, placeholders like <player> and custom PAPI placeholders will be expanded.

# Global header/footer (MiniMessage)
header: "<gradient:sunset>Welcome, <player>!</gradient>"
footer: "<gray>Have fun on the server | <gold>play.example.com</gold>"

# How often (in server ticks) the tablist will refresh for all players.
# 20 ticks = 1 second. Default: 100 ticks = 5s
refresh-interval-ticks: 100

# Enable PlaceholderAPI integration if PlaceholderAPI is present
enable-papi: true

# Persist per-player toggles under 'toggles.<uuid>' in this config
persist-toggles: true

# Formats: multiple named formats. Each format may specify a permission and a priority.
# The format with the highest priority that the player matches will be applied.
formats:
  default:
    permission: ""      # empty = no permission requirement (applies to everyone)
    priority: 0
    header: "<gradient:default>Welcome, <player></gradient>"
    footer: "<yellow>Players: <player_count></yellow>"

  staff:
    permission: "etab.staff"   # permission node required to use this format
    priority: 10
    header: "<gradient:staff>Staff Online</gradient>"
    footer: "<red>Moderation Tools Enabled</red>"
